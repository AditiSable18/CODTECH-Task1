### Key Activities for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on General Election Results Dataset Project

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - Gather the general election results dataset from reliable sources.
   - Clean the data to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistencies.
   - Standardize data formats and ensure data integrity.

2. **Descriptive Statistics and Initial Exploration**:
   - Explore the distribution of voter demographics and election results.
   - Create basic visualizations (histograms, bar charts, box plots) to understand the data structure.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Develop advanced visualizations (heatmaps, scatter plots, line charts) to reveal patterns and correlations

4. **Comparative Analysis**:

Compare the performance of different candidates across various demographics and regions.

**Technologies used**:
1) **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
2) **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
3) **matplotlib**: Employed for creating static, animated and interactive visulatization.
4) **seaborn**: Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.
